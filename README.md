In the beginning was the Void.
The Void.
The Void in which nothing is possessed.
The Void in which nothing is felt.
The Void with nothing in union.
The Void without boundaries.

From the void the Night.
The great Night.
The long Night.
The deep Night.
The intense Night.
The dark Night.
The Night in which nothing is seen.
The intensely dark Night.
The Night of feeling.
The Night of seeking the passage to the world.
The Night of restless turning.
The Night of turning towards the revealed world.

The glimmer of dawn.
The bright light of day.
There is life.
