------------------------------------------------------
--MANTLE
These occassionally turn up in caves near the bottom of basement rock level.
This is about the  depth at which drilling deeper is actually impossible.

--cold mantle
Some volcanic sand to go 'Ohhhh Volcanoey!''

--wet mantle

--------------------------------------------------------------
--BASEMENT ROCKS
The deep underlying rocks of the country. Self-explanatory.
Greywacke hitting the plate boundary and being turned into schist, then gneiss.
And some random granite.
